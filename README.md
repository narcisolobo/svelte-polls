# Svelte Polls

This project was created while following a [tutorial video series on YouTube from Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hlbrVO_2QFVqVPhlZmz7tO). If you haven't watched any of his videos, I highly recommend them. I'm a teacher by trade, and he's a fantastic teacher.

As with all the tutorials I follow, I try to do things a little differently. For this project, I used SvelteKit instead of vanilla Svelte, TypeScript instead of JavaScript, and Tailwind instead of vanilla CSS.
